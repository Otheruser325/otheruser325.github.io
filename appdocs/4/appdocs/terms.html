login and other PII such as IP address will not be stored. Further GDPR 
information is also located in our Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>This Terms of Service and the Ninja Kiwi Privacy Policy are

<p><strong>Limited License; Content; Ownership</strong></p>

Service, Ninja Kiwi grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
non-sublicensable, revocable limited license to access, play, and 
otherwise use the Ninja Kiwi Applications and Services provided such

Services, related communications, and all content including but not 
limited to graphics, audio, text, user interface, characters,

reproduce, frame, copy, post, sell, scrape, transmit, clone accounts, 
clone characters, or create related or derivative works is expressly 
prohibited and immediately terminates the limited license granted and

video, stream, social network, public display, digital communications, 
or any other mass audience channel is expressly prohibited and 
immediately terminates the limited license granted and will lead to the 
segregation and/or suspension of your account.</p>
<p>Any and all content including but not limited to bloons, monkeys, 
buildings, towers, characters, environments, maps, worlds, creatures, 
items, pets, homes, robots, tools, weapons, powers, powerups, upgrades, 
equipment, display areas, user interface, virtual currency, or any other
 virtual items or organized display or use of any such items remains the
 sole and exclusive property of Ninja Kiwi. No amount of customization, 
stat changes, item changes, configuration, leveling up, decorating, or 
in any other way modifying game elements through use of the Application,
 Ninja Kiwi Login, Ninja Kiwi Services, or any other means conveys any 
ownership or alteration of the limited license to use; all elements 
remain the sole and exclusive property of Ninja Kiwi.</p>
<p>Where Ninja Kiwi games provide in-game tools such as but not limited 
to the Bloons TD 6 Content Browser Challenge Creator, Odyssey Creator, 
and Map Editor that allow players to modify, customize, and otherwise 
manipulate game content to create player-generated content for display 
and play within or outside Ninja Kiwi games whether private or public, 
all such content remains the exclusive property of Ninja Kiwi Limited, 
and any use of such tools to create and display content is done on a 
voluntary basis without any right, claim, or interest to compensation of
 any kind, except as defined specifically for content creator and player
 creator revenue sharing as detailed in the Fan Content and Player 
Creator Content and Revenue Sharing sections below.</p>
<p>Ninja Kiwi reserves the right at its sole discretion and without 
notice to make changes, modifications, additions, deletions, copies, or 
any other alterations and edits to any and all content elements,

behavior, performance, cost, component parts, display, visibility, or 
in-game value. Ninja Kiwi reserves the right at its sole discretion and 
without notice to delete, suspend, or modify any item, feature, account 
or the entire Application, Ninja Kiwi Login, or Services. In the event 
that access to the Application, Ninja Kiwi Login, or Services is 
terminated, all virtual items, virtual currency, and player’s game 
progress is forfeited and you will not receive any compensation, 
monetary or otherwise, for any of these elements forfeited. Any 
suspension or termination of your access to the Application, Ninja Kiwi 
Login, or Services will not waive or diminish your obligations under 
these Terms of Service (including but not limited to ownership, 
indemnification, and limitation of liability).</p>
<p><strong>Fan Content</strong></p>
<p>Ninja Kiwi supports the maintenance and growth of healthy, 
non-sponsored communities, fan-art channels, and content 
creator/streamer ecosystems and seeks to encourage and support fan 
creations that use or perform our IP, as long as they adhere to these 
Terms.</p>
<p>Fan Content includes but is not limited to art, animation, memes, 
crafts, game designs, game mechanics, stories, ‘ships, music, videos, 
merchandise, printed material, and any other creation that uses Ninja 
Kiwi IP, as well as any performance of Ninja Kiwi IP, including but not 
limited to video content creation and streaming as appears on platforms 
like Twitch and YouTube. Fan Content must comply with each of the 
following requirements; any fan content that violates the following 
requirements is prohibited :
a. Streamers and content creators may monetize their performances of 
Ninja Kiwi IP through platform (e.g. Twitch or YouTube) ads, platform 
currencies, and other standard platform methods provided the performance
 of the Ninja Kiwi IP must adhere to all other conditions of these 
Terms;
b. Fan Content other than streamer and content creator performances on 
major platforms as described at (a) above must have no commercial and/or
 monetary objective or implementation;
c. Fan Content must not be posted as stand alone products whether free 
or for purchase to commercial platforms such as app stores (e.g. Apple 
App Store, Google Play Store, Steam) or content stores (e.g. Spotify, 
Bandcamp, Printful, Redbubble, Zazzle, Etsy). For clarity, this does not
 restrict streamers and content creators from posting their Fan Content 
to content creator platforms available on app stores (e.g. Twitch, 
Youtube, and Facebook);
d. Fan Content must not use the Ninja Kiwi company or game logos or 
trademarks and must not be presented in any way that could cause people 
or search algorithms to react as if it was an official Ninja Kiwi 
production or post;
e. Fan Content must not derogate Ninja Kiwi, Ninja Kiwi games or 
services, or Ninja Kiwi staff or otherwise cause damage to the 
reputation, public perception, or goodwill of Ninja Kiwi or its games or
 brands, as determined solely by Ninja Kiwi; 
f. Fan Content must not be used to communicate, link, distribute, or 
promote cheats or hacks to any Ninja Kiwi games;
g. Fan Content must not be obscene, sexually explicit, defamatory, 
hateful, or harmful to others, as determined solely by Ninja Kiwi;
g. You acknowledge that Ninja Kiwi games appeal to broad audiences that 
may include children and as such Fan Content should be appropriate for 
broad audiences or gated behind sufficient warning for mature content as
 provided by performance platforms, and you further acknowledge your 
understanding that Ninja Kiwi will not promote any Fan Content that is 
not appropriate for broad audiences.</p>
<p>If you have a channel on YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, or another 
platform and have any questions about media kits, game information, or 
just want to say hello, please get in touch with us at 
streamers@ninjakiwi.com; there is no obligation or requirement to 
contact Ninja Kiwi, but we do like to hear from people finding fun and 
value creating content with Ninja Kiwi IP in accordance with these 
Terms.</p>
<p>Content creators and streamers can also participate in a revenue 
share exchange managed by Nexus.gg and subject to their terms: 
https://www.nexus.gg/legal/terms-of-use .</p>
<p>As a standard practice, Ninja Kiwi does not accept Fan Content 
submitted directly to Ninja Kiwi for the Application, Ninja Kiwi Login, 
and/or Services of any other Ninja Kiwi game or property. From time to 
time, Ninja Kiwi may run promotions based on Fan Content for the purpose
 of community engagement. Whether part of a promotion or unsolicited, if
 you make any Fan Content submissions to Ninja Kiwi via any delivery 
mechanism including but not limited to blogs, forums, emails, letters, 
videos, community sites, or social networking posts and comments, you 
acknowledge your understanding that Ninja Kiwi is in the business of 
making games and is constantly creating game ideas, features, concepts, 
technologies, designs, mechanics, and all other elements for 
Applications or Services and likely has ideas that are similar to or 
identical to your submissions. In addition, you acknowledge that you 
will receive no compensation or credit and that your submission is not 
confidential. By communicating the submission, you warrant that you are 
the originator of the idea and that it does not infringe on the rights 
of any other person or entity, and you grant Ninja Kiwi a worldwide, 
royalty-free, non-exclusive perpetual right and license to use, modify, 
translate, publish, perform, produce derivative works, and in any other 
way manifest the submission without any liability, payment, or expense. 
Ninja Kiwi at its sole discretion and where possible will make efforts 
to acknowledge promotional Fan Content submissions that are 
reinterpreted and/or reauthored by Ninja Kiwi and subsequently 
incorporated into any Applications or Services.</p>
<p><strong>Player Creator Content and Revenue Sharing</strong></p>
<p>Player Creator Content is defined as any content created within any 
Ninja Kiwi game or service that can then be shared with other players 
for their use, performance, and enjoyment. The main examples of Player 
Created Content are the Challenge, Odyssey, and Map creations within 
Bloons TD 6. All such Player Created Content is bound by these Terms.</p>
<p>While all Player Creator Content creation is voluntary and is done 
without any right, claim, or interest in compensation of any kind, Ninja
 Kiwi is facilitating a platform-specific revenue share from In App 
Purchases made from players who are actively playing a Player Creator’s 
Challenge, Odyssey, and/or Map creations; this revenue share is 
conditional on the Player Creator:
a) creating a Nexus.gg account;
b) linking that Nexus account to their Ninja Kiwi player account, and;
c) accepting the Nexus.gg terms: 
https://www.nexus.gg/legal/terms-of-use.
For additional visibility, the Nexus.gg terms restrict revenue share 
participation to players 18 years of age and older.</p>
<p>Because IAPs and/or IAP validation are not available on all platforms
 where Bloons TD 6 is distributed, players on Apple Arcade, Netflix, 
Amazon App Store, and Windows Store cannot give Accolades. Because of 
platform specific data constraints, player creators on Apple Arcade and 
Netflix cannot receive revenue sharing.</p>
<p>Revenue share amounts are subject to change at Ninja Kiwi’s sole 
discretion and without notice, but reasonable efforts will be made to 
update the current revenue share percentage within the Accolades Store 
information panel when playing Bloons TD 6 while connected to the 
internet.</p>
<p>Player creator data related to revenue sharing will be stored for six
 months from the time of content creation to allow players to take their
 time to register with Nexus.gg and link their accounts. Potential 
revenue share older than six months before Nexus.gg registration will 
not be stored or claimable.</p>
<p><strong>Merchandise</strong></p>
<p>Ninja Kiwi provides IP related merchandise for sale at 
https://store.ninjakiwi.com, and this merchandise is sold in accordance 
with Store Policies available at 
https://store.ninjakiwi.com/pages/store-policies.</p>
<p>Ninja Kiwi supports and encourages fan creativity in the creation of 
Fan Content merchandise provided it adheres to all of the requirements 
of Fan Content. Making limited-run (50 or less) hand-authored prints, 
t-shirts, stickers, and other merchandise for non-commercial 
distribution to friends and other fans is permitted so long as they 
adhere to all of the requirements of Fan Content and are not similar to 
any items listed at https://store.ninjakiwi.com.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Currency and Premium Items</strong></p>
<p>Through use of the Application, Ninja Kiwi Login, or Services you may
 accumulate virtual currency and virtual items whose sole use is within 
the Application, Ninja Kiwi Login, or Services where they were obtained.
 Ninja Kiwi engages with industry leading platform storefronts, 
including but not limited to Apple’s App Store, Google Play, Amazon’s 
App Store, and Steam, and with reputable third party services to allow 
purchase of virtual currency with real world currency, and Ninja Kiwi 
reserves the right to enable or disable any in-game acquisition of or 
real world purchase of virtual currency. Ninja Kiwi reserves the right 
at its sole discretion and without notice to change the rate of exchange
 for in-game or purchased virtual currency or the cost of any in-game 
item. Use of the platform storefront or third party service for purchase
 of virtual currency is governed by the terms of use of that service and
 any issues with that transaction are to be resolved with that platform 
storefront or third party service according to their support procedures.
 Ninja Kiwi will offer support assistance in contacting and attempting 
to resolve such platform storefront or third party service issues if you
 email support@ninjakiwi.com.
You understand and acknowledge that Ninja Kiwi is not required to 
provide a refund for any currency or other item for any reason. Further,
 you understand and acknowledge that you will receive no money or other 
compensation for unused virtual currency, premium items, or any other 
game resources when an account is closed, when an account is suspended, 
when an Application or Service is under maintenance, offline, closed, or
 otherwise unavailable, or when your data has been lost, corrupted, 
deleted, or otherwise made unavailable. Ninja Kiwi reserves the right at
 its sole discretion and without notice to remove, suspend, or close any
 Application or Service without any compensation to you.</p>
<p>Parents and guardians acknowledge that your children and wards may 
purchase virtual currency only with your supervision and authorization. 
We encourage all players, regardless of age, to understand their device 
settings and limit or restrict in-app purchasing on their device if they
 do not wish to engage with in-app purchase features. Additional 
information on restricting in-app purchases is available here:
https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1626831
https://support.apple.com/HT204396
https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html</p>
<p>Virtual currency and items are non-transferrable to any other 
Application, Service, website, or anywhere else. Virtual currency, 
virtual items, and player progress are not redeemable for any monetary 
value from Ninja Kiwi, any third party service, or any other entity. You
 agree not to sell, exchange, or attempt to transfer virtual currency, 
virtual items, or player progress, and any such actions will not be 
tolerated by Ninja Kiwi and will lead to suspension of your Ninja Kiwi 
account.</p>
<p>Whether you obtained virtual currency and virtual items through use 
of the Application, Ninja Kiwi Login, and Services, by purchase via a 
third party service, or by interacting with advertisements, you have no 
right or title to any virtual currency, virtual items, or any other game
 assets.
You agree to pay all fees and related taxes incurred by you or anyone 
using an account that is registered to you. You agree to pay all 
internet, carrier, device, power, repair, replacement, data, bandwidth 
and any other fees and related taxes related to the operation of any 
equipment or devices required to access any Application or Service.</p>

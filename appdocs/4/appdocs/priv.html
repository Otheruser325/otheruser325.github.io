<p>Last Update: October 24, 2024</p>
<p>Hello and Welcome to Ninja Kiwi’s Privacy Policy!</p>
<p>We are committed to making our games both fun and safe to use. In 
general, our approach is to only collect anonymous data wherever 
possible and use as little personal data as is necessary to provide the 
best games and services. We don’t gather or use anonymous data or any 
personal information to sell these to third parties for commercial 
purposes; we only want to make our games more awesomer.</p>
<p>Please take a moment and read this Privacy Policy. It will help you 
understand how we process your personal data. Depending on the specific 
case it is possible that other privacy policies of ours may apply 
additionally, in which case we will inform you about this additional 
application (e.g., by referring to them). If you have any questions 
regarding our use of your personal data, please feel free to contact us 
over the channels provided below.</p>
<p>When you or your children or wards use Ninja Kiwi games and services, our <a href="https://ninjakiwi.com/terms" target="parent">Terms of Service</a>

wards should not use any Ninja Kiwi games or services unless you agree 
to this.</p>
<p>The descriptions of how we process your personal data, your rights, 
and limitations to processing your personal data that are mentioned in 
this privacy policy apply to you when you use our services. They are

GDPR") and the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") which applies
 when you reside in the United Kingdom or European Union and use our 
services.</p>
<p>If you do not reside in the UK or EU and use our services, the 
descriptions of this privacy policy may not fully apply to you and other
 data protection laws might be applicable. If you are a resident of the 
State of California, please see Section X below for detailed information
 according to the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").</p>
<p>When we refer to "you" in this Privacy Policy, we refer to you as

<h2 id="iijointcontrollerships">II. Joint Controllerships</h2>
<p><strong>What does joint controllership mean?</strong></p>
<p>We and our subsidiaries, Ninja Kiwi Europe Ltd and Ninja Kiwi 
Americas LLC ("Subsidiaries"), cooperate closely together to provide our
 games and services. This means that we and our Subsidiary jointly 
determine if and how personal data of yours is processed. Since we and 
our Subsidiary each are controllers of your data when doing so, the 
working relationship is called a joint controllership. Our Subsidiaries 
are:</p>
<pre><code>Ninja Kiwi Europe Ltd.
Unit 13 The Vision Building
20 Greenmarket
Dundee DD1 4QB
Scotland
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>Ninja Kiwi Americas LLC

<p>Our Subsidiaries’ group data protection officer ("DPO") is</p>
<pre><code>Kat Small
c/o Ninja Kiwi Europe Ltd.
Unit 13 The Vision Building
20 Greenmarket
Dundee DD1 4QB
Scotland 
</code></pre>
<p>You can reach out to our DPO regarding any data protection matters by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@ninjakiwi.com">privacy@ninjakiwi.com</a> and noting that you are addressing our Subsidiary.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a contract between us and our Subsidiaries?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We and our Subsidiaries have concluded a contract that 
legitimises any data flows between us and our Subsidiary. It contains 
rules for joint controllerships between us, especially which company is 
responsible for what when it comes to your personal data. </p>
<p><strong>In which cases do we process your data together with our Subsidiaries and why?</strong></p>
<p>We cooperate with our Subsidiary and jointly process personal data with them in the following cases: </p>
<ul>
<li>We and our Subsidiary administer HR matters related to data subjects
 outside of the EU and process personal data related to this (e.g., 
regarding job applications and performance reviews).    </li>
<li>We and our Subsidiary share IT services that are provided and 
administered by Ninja Kiwi Ltd. and through this process personal data 
such as personal data of yours when you play Ninja Kiwi games or use our
 services as well as personal data of employees of partners who 
cooperate with us and/or our Subsidiary. </li>
<li>We and our Subsidiary jointly market Ninja Kiwi products and 
services. For this purpose, we and our Subsidiary may process personal 
data, such as player data (e.g., your name when responding to a post of 
yours in our social media channels), as joint controllers. Such data is 
managed separately. However, we and our Subsidiary may jointly decide 
whether and how personal data is used for marketing purposes.</li>
<li>We and our Subsidiary may share the services of Ninja Kiwi’s 
external legal consultants (e.g., lawyers) for any legal questions and 
for administering and cooperating in intercompany matters. Through this 
we and our Subsidiary may jointly process personal data such as names 
and other personal data provided in connection with a legal assessment 
or proceeding.</li>
<li>We and our Subsidiary jointly handle data protection requests that 
you as data subject might send us (e.g., if you want to have your data 
deleted). Through this we and our Subsidiary may jointly process 
personal data such as names and other personal data provided in 
connection with your request.</li>
<li>We and our Subsidiary jointly process data required for playing our 
games (e.g., account data) and visiting our websites (e.g., IP 
addresses).</li>
<li>We and our Subsidiary jointly process analytical data that one of us
 might collect within a game or on a website of ours to improve how our 
games and website work.</li>
<li>We and our Subsidiary jointly process personal data required for 
purchases made in our online shop, e.g., to be able to send you the 
merch you bought.</li>
<li>We and our Subsidiary jointly process personal data in relation to raffles and giveaways.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find further details on how we and our Subsidiary jointly 
process your data in the respective section below (see Section VII. that
 gives specifics on how we use your data).</p>
<p><strong>Who is responsible for what?</strong></p>
<p>If not expressly stated otherwise in this Section, our Subsidiary, 
Ninja Kiwi Europe Ltd, is responsible for safeguarding your rights set 
out in this Privacy Policy, when processing your personal data. In such 
case, our Subsidiary is your primary contact point for all requests you 
may have relating to data protection. You can at any time of course also
 contact us to exercise your data subject rights. We and our Subsidiary 
can assist each other to comply with our obligations of the UK GDPR that
 apply regarding you and will inform each other about matters of 
significance to a joint controllership. Irrespective of this, the UK 
GDPR grants you the possibility to exercise your rights in respect of 
and against each of the joint controllers.</p>
<p><strong>How is your data secured?</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented technical and organisational measures to ensure a
 level of security appropriate to the risk presented by the processing 
in accordance with Art. 24 and 32 UK GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in a case of a personal data breach?</strong></p>
<p>In case of a personal data breach and if this breach is likely to 
result in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will, with the 
assistance of our Subsidiary and without undue delay and, if possible, 
not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the data
 breach to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and/or if data of
 EU citizens is affected the competent supervisory authority of the EU. 
Should such a breach likely result in a high risk for your rights and 
freedoms, we or – where required by article 34 UK GDPR – our Subsidiary 
will inform you about the personal data breach without undue delay.</p>
<p><strong>Contact:</strong>
If you want to exercise your rights afforded by UK GDPR regulations or 
if you have any questions for us regarding the processing, you can 
contact us via email: <a href="mailto:privacy@ninjakiwi.com">privacy@ninjakiwi.com</a></p>
<p>Depending on your request, it is possible that our Subsidiary or we 
will forward your request to one another; should this be necessary to 
help each other out to answer your request or to get directly in touch 
with you for this purpose. In case of a forward of your request, we and 
our Subsidiary inform each other about the matter to the extent 
necessary for answering your request.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iiimeaningofterms">III. Meaning of Terms</h2>
<p>Some terms we use in this Privacy Policy are defined by the UK 
General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR"), a data protection law of
 the UK. When we refer to the UK GDPR we are referring to the General 
Data Protection Regulation of the European Union as well since both laws
 are very similar, unless we otherwise specify that we are referring to 
only one of them.</p>
<p>Art. 4 UK GDPR gives detailed definitions of terms which we also 
apply in this Privacy Policy. We’d like to explicitly mention the 
meanings of the following terms in simple words since they are used 
quite often throughout this Privacy Policy. Check out Art. 4 UK GDPR for
 the detailed definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘personal data’ means any information relating to a person that can 
be identified or could be identified through an identifier (‘data 
subject’); </li>
<li>‘processing’ means using your personal data (e.g., collecting, storing, sharing or deleting it);</li>
<li>‘controller’ means the person, company or other body that decides if and how your personal data is being processed;</li>
<li>‘processor’ means a person, company or other body that processes 
personal data on behalf of the controller according to the controller’s 
instructions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="ivlegalbasis">IV. Legal Basis</h2>
<p>As a controller we need a legal basis to be allowed to process your personal data. If:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have given us your consent to process your personal data, this 
forms a legal basis according to Art. 6 para. 1 let. a) UK GDPR;</li>
<li>you have given us your consent to process special categories of 
personal data (e.g. data concerning health) for one or more specified 
purposes, and such consent is possible according to applicable law, this
 forms a legal basis according to Art. 9 para. 2 let. a) UK GDPR;</li>
<li>processing your personal data is necessary for the performance of a 
contract between you and us or in order to take steps at your request 
prior to entering into a contract, the legal basis for this is Art. 6 
para. 1 let. b) UK GDPR;</li>
<li>processing your personal data is necessary for compliance with a 
legal obligation to which we are subject, the legal basis for this is 
Art. 6 para. 1 let. c) UK GDPR;</li>
<li>processing your personal data is necessary because we or a third 
party have a legitimate interest to do so and such legitimate interests 
are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms,
 the legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 let. f) UK GDPR.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="vyourrights">V. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Under the UK GDPR you have the following rights when we process your personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right of information: You can ask us to let you know what we are 
doing with your data, e.g., why we collect it, or for how long we keep 
it (Art. 13 and 14 UK GDPR).</li>
<li>Right of access: You can at any time ask us to confirm as to whether
 or not we are processing your personal data and, if this should be the 
case, access to the personal data (Art. 15 UK GDPR).</li>
<li>Right to rectification: If you find that personal data that we 
process about you is inaccurate, you can ask us to correct it (Art. 16 
UK GDPR).</li>
<li>Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"): Under certain 
circumstances, e.g., if you have objected to us using your data or if 
you have withdrawn your consent, you can ask us to delete your personal 
data. There are certain exceptions to this, e.g., if this would 
contradict other people’s free speech or if we have a legal obligation 
for which we need the data (Art. 17 UK GDPR).</li>
<li>Right to restriction: Under certain circumstances, e.g., if your 
personal data we store isn’t accurate or you have objected to us using 
your personal data, you have the right to request that we restrict the 
processing of your personal data until a solution has been found (Art. 
18 UK GDPR).</li>
<li>Right to data portability: Under certain circumstances you can 
receive your personal data you have provided us in a structured, 
commonly used and machine-readable format and you can transfer this data
 to another controller (Art. 20 UK GDPR).</li>
<li>Right to object: Under certain circumstances, e.g., if we base the 
use of your personal data on a legitimate interest, you have the right 
to object to us using your data. If we don’t have an overriding interest
 to keep using your data, we will stop using it (Art. 21 UK GDPR). </li>
<li>Right to lodge a complaint: You can always send a complaint 
regarding our processing of your personal data to a data protection 
supervisory authority (Art. 77 UK GDPR).</li>
<li>Right to withdraw consent: If you have granted us your consent for 
us to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your 
consent at any time with effect for the future (Art. 7 para. 3 UK GDPR).
 </li>
<li>Right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated 
processing: You have the right not to be subject to a decision based 
solely on automated processing which produces legal effects for you or 
similarly significantly affects you (Art. 22 para 1 UK GDPR). We do not 
make automated decisions by processing your personal data (e.g., 
profiling you).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="virecipientscategoriesofrecipients">VI. Recipients / Categories of Recipients</h2>
<p>The personal data we process can also be either processed by other 
parties on our behalf and according to our instructions by processors or
 shared with and processed by other controllers. When data is processed 
according to this Privacy Policy, it is principally done so by employees
 and freelancers of ours that are responsible for the specific matter 
the data is required for.</p>

<p>Some of these recipients are established outside of the European 
Union. Principally, there are two possible safeguards we rely on when we
 share your personal data with these recipients:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a recipient is located in a country for which the European 
Commission ("EU Commission") has found it ok to send personal data to, 
since that country provides an adequate level of data protection, we 
rely on this so-called adequacy decision by the EU Commission.</li>
<li>If a recipient is not located in a country with an adequate level of
 data protection according to the EU Commission, we have concluded a 
special contract with this recipient in which we agree on rules to make 
sure the recipient takes adequate care of your personal data. This 
contract is called the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and was developed
 by the EU Commission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we are located in New Zealand, any data that is transferred to 
us from our Subsidiaries is transferred to a country that is recognised 
by the EU Commission as a country that provides an adequate level of 
data protection. Any data that is transferred by us to our Subsidiary in
 the UK is transferred to a country that provides an adequate level of 
data protection according to the EU Commission.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the following categories of recipients process data 
either on our behalf or with us as joint controllers or as individual 
controllers: financial and IT services; media; social media platforms; 
website analytics providers; messaging systems; gameplay analytics. </p>
<p>You can find further information on which recipients and categories 
of recipients are involved in the processing of personal data under 
Section VII. </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="viigeneraldataprocessing">VII. General Data Processing</h2>
<p>In the following we’d like to inform you about how we process your 
personal data. These are the general processing activities that can 
apply when you interact with us. Every processing activity is broken 
down into 5 parts:</p>
<p>(a.) What: What data is processed?
(b.) Who: Who receives the data?
(c.) Why: For what purpose is the data processed?
(d.) Legal Basis: What law allows us to process the data?
(e.) How Long: How long do we keep the data?</p>
<h3 id="1communicatingwithyou">1. Communicating With You</h3>
<p><strong>a. What</strong></p>
<p>If we communicate with you via email, mail, or telephone, we process 
all personal data you disclose to us during our conversation (e.g., you 
name, email address, the reason why you are contacting us etc.).</p>
<p>Apart from this, it is also possible that we use other online 
messaging systems to communicate with you, if you wish to contact us 
over these channels. Please note that if you wish to contact us via such
 messaging systems, it is possible that the respective companies that 
offer these communication services may also process your personal data 
and that regarding this their privacy policies apply. We have no 
influence over such data processing by third parties. For further 
information on how these services process your personal data, please 
view their privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>b. Who</strong></p>
<p>Recipients of the processed personal data are the respective internal
 employees and freelancers of ours that are responsible for pursuing our
 purposes for the processing (e.g., someone from a department that you 
are contacting with a request). Possible further recipients: the 
providers of the respective messaging systems; Facebook, Twitter, 
Discord, Zendesk</p>
<p>Depending on the specific topic of the conversation as well as the 
circumstances (e.g., a certain game you’re playing) it is possible that

 partner as well as to have proof regarding substantial content of our 
conversation, including but not limited to cases of potential legal

respective conversation will be continued within the foreseeable future.
 Any other data will be retained for a period of five years starting

<h3 id="3ninjakiwiwebsiteregistration">3. Ninja Kiwi Website Registration</h3>
<p><strong>a. What</strong></p>
<p>Registration for ninjakiwi.com is exclusively for the website and 
does not apply to mobile games or forums, which are separate 
registrations. Registration asks for username, email, and password or 
for 3rd party login via Facebook or Google. Players under the age of 16 
 are directed specifically to use parent or guardian emails. </p>
<p>Your Ninja Kiwi Website profile will have multiple stats stored on 
our servers which are based on your web game performance and actions. 
For example, profile level, coins earned, clan chosen, etc.</p>
<p><strong>b. Who</strong></p>
<p>Recipients of the processed personal data are the respective 
employees and freelancers of ours that are responsible for processing 
the data. Possible further recipients: IT service providers and host 
providers.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific case, it is possible that our Subsidiaries 
jointly process personal data with us according to Sect. II.</p>
<p><strong>c. Why</strong></p>
<p>While you do not need to register to play many of the games on 
ninjakiwi.com, several games or game features will not work without a 
successfully registered account, since they are online multiplayer or 
online co-op games with the key feature of playing with or against other
 players. Also, we cannot provide effective customer support for game 
progress in such games without a successfully registered account.</p>
<p>We might email all registered players in the case of legal notices or major company news.</p>
<p><strong>d. Legal Basis</strong></p>
<p>The legal basis for processing the data is to enter into or perform a
 contract we concluded with you is Art. 6 para. 1 let. b) UK GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>e. How long</strong></p>
<p>Your account data is stored for as long as you maintain your account 
which can be closed anytime at your request, or it will be deleted 
automatically after 5 years of inactivity. If possible, we will notify 
you one week before we delete your inactive account to give you the 
possibility to keep your account if you wish.</p>
<p>If the data is also processed for another purpose set out in this 
Privacy Policy, the storage period regarding that purpose applies as 
well.</p>
<h3 id="4ninjakiwiaccountregistration">4. Ninja Kiwi Account Registration</h3>
<p><strong>a. What</strong></p>
<p>When you register for a Ninja Kiwi account, this account can be used 
across most Ninja Kiwi games but does not provide registration to 
ninjakiwi.com or forums. You may provide us with an email that we use as
 a unique identifier for your account or choose a 3rd party login like 
Facebook, Apple, Google, Steam, Twitch, or Gamecenter.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 16 you are allowed to register for Ninja 
Kiwi accounts, but you cannot supply any personally identifiable 
information (e.g., no email address or name) and are instead generated:</p>
<ul>
<li>a random non-editable player name,</li>
<li>a randomly assigned unique long and short code, and</li>
<li>a randomly assigned unique recovery code. </li>
</ul>
<p>For games with social guilds such as Clans, Parties, or Teams, you 
must identify your age before you join a Clan, Party, or Team in these 
games, and you are then excluded from sending, receiving, or reading any
 user generated chat messages. Depending on the game, chat is either 
completely disabled or limited to canned messages for users under 16. 
Instead of simply excluding minor players from the game or from 
participating in social guilds, we chose this approach as it allows 
underage players to participate in the fun of social guild play and be 
part of a team, but without risking personal data sharing. </p>
<p>If you are 16 and over you can use the chat functionality. For this 
functionality we process the information you enter into the chat.</p>
<p>Please note that for some games, your leaderboard scores and player name may be publicly available to other players.</p>
<p><strong>b. Who</strong></p>
<p>Recipients of the processed personal data are the respective 
employees and freelancers of ours that are responsible for processing 
the data. Possible further recipients: IT service providers and host 
providers.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific case, it is possible that our Subsidiaries 
jointly process personal data with us according to Sect. II.</p>
<p><strong>c. Why</strong></p>
<p>The registration data is required so you can play the game as 
intended to allow you to contact support@ninjakiwi.com from that email, 
so that customer support can immediately validate the account ownership 
and offer assistance more quickly.</p>
<p>If you are considered a minor, the randomly assigned nickname is 
required to identify you as a player for other players in the game, the 
short and long randomly assigned unique codes are required so we can 
make the game work and the randomly assigned recovery code can be used 
by you to get support from us.</p>
<p>We might email all registered players in the case of legal notices or major company news, provided we have their email address.</p>
<p><strong>d. Legal Basis</strong></p>
<p>The legal basis for processing the data to enter into or perform a 
contract we concluded with you is Art. 6 para. 1 let. b) UK GDPR as well
 as Art. 6 para. 1 let. f) UK GDPR since it’s a legitimate interest of 
ours to provide you a game that works properly.</p>
<p><strong>e. How long</strong></p>
<p>Your account data is stored for as long as you maintain your account 
which can be closed anytime at your request, or it will be deleted 
automatically after 5 years of inactivity. If possible, we will notify 
you one week before we delete your inactive account to give you the 
possibility to keep your account if you wish.</p>
<p>Chat data is deleted automatically four weeks after being sent.</p>

Privacy Policy, the storage period regarding that purpose applies as

<h3 id="5gamedata">5. Game Data</h3>
<p><strong>a. What</strong></p>
<p>We track gameplay information about the way you play our mobile 
games, which includes game and player progress information that is 
essential for saving and protecting that progress. Analytics track 
elements of the game you interact with most and least frequently, where 
you stop playing or play less, and other aspects of aggregating player 
progression through the game. </p>
<p>For players aged 16, IP address, device type, OS type, time stamp, 
and other general device level information are accessed and stored on 
distributed, scalable servers. For players under age 16 no personal data
 is stored.</p>
<p><strong>b. Who</strong></p>

providers.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific case, it is possible that our Subsidiaries 
jointly process personal data with us according to Sect. II.</p>

report technical issues as well as for anti-cheat purposes. We also use 
gameplay information to identify the most engaging components of our 
game designs, so we can better concentrate our development work where 
players are having the most fun. These are legitimate interests of ours 
and our players.</p>
<p><strong>d. Legal Basis</strong></p>

automatically after 5 years of inactivity.  If possible, we will notify 
you one week before we delete your inactive account to give you the 
possibility to keep your account if you wish. If you delete your 
account, analytics data will be kept under a random anonymous ID that 
cannot be linked to you after you have deleted your account.</p>
<p>If the data is also processed for another purpose set out in this 
Privacy Policy, the storage period regarding that purpose applies as 
well.</p>
<h3 id="6advertising">6. Advertising</h3>
<p><strong>a. What</strong></p>
<p>Since some of our games are free to download and play, we display ads
 in many of these free games. The advertising companies pay us for 
displaying the ads and this makes it possible for us to offer you the 
game free of charge. Apart from this, we might also give you the 
possibility to watch an ad instead of paying for a feature that you 
otherwise would have to pay for in a game of ours. When displaying ads, 
we use third-party advertising companies to serve the ads in our games. 
The third-party advertising companies may collect and use information 
(but not your name, address, email address, telephone number, or other 
personal data) about how you play our games.</p>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information to manage and measure the 
delivery of advertising within that game can be collected, including the
 number of times the same advertisement is served and viewed.</p>
<p>For players registered as under age 16 we use designated non-personal
 data ad calls that either do not send personal data (usually IP 
address) or encrypt that personal data so that we have no access to it. 
Ad companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., 
click stream information, browser type, time and date, heat maps, player
 behaviour) when you play our games in order to provide ads about goods 
and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies 
typically use a cookie or third-party beacon to collect this 
information. We do not have access to this information or influence over
 third party ad network policies, barring our ability to discontinue 
their services.</p>
<p>You can choose to agree or disagree with us sharing your personal 
data for displaying targeted ads depending on which platform you play 
our games:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS: Choose from the consent pop-up at the start of the game (if you
 haven’t already generally disabled tracking in your system settings).</li>
<li>Android: Opt out of ad tracking by going to Settings &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalisation</li>
<li>Fire OS: Opt out of ad tracking by going to Settings &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Advertising ID &gt; Interest-Based Ads</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like more information about advertising practices and to
 know your choices about not having this information used by these 
companies, you can visit Google's Advertising and Privacy page or the 
Network Advertising Initiative. Please understand that if you disable or
 block certain ad features, then other aspects of our mobile games may 
not work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>b. Who</strong></p>
<p>Recipients of the processed personal data are the respective 
employees and freelancers of ours that are responsible for pursuing our 
purposes for the processing. Possible further recipients: Ad Networks.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific case, it is possible that our Subsidiaries 
jointly process personal data with us according to Sect. II.</p>
<p><strong>c. Why</strong></p>
<p>The data is processed by us to provide advertisements about goods and
 services of interest to you. We offer our mobile games for free, so 
these ads allow us to continue making and updating top quality free 
games which is a legitimate interest of ours but also of yours if you 
want to play games for free. Without displaying personalised ads, we 
would not make sufficient money to keep offering the games for free to 
you. </p>
<p><strong>d. Legal Basis</strong>
The legal basis for processing your personal data for personalised ads 
on iOS is your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 let. a) UK GDPR). If you are an 
Android player, the legal basis is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para.
 1 let. f) UK GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>e. How long</strong></p>
<p>The data is stored for as long as you maintain your account which can
 be closed anytime at your request, or it will be closed automatically 
after 5 years of inactivity.  If possible, we will notify you one week 
before we delete your inactive account to give you the possibility to 
keep your account if you wish. If you delete your account, analytics 
data will be kept under a random anonymous ID that cannot be linked to 
you after you have deleted your account.</p>

Privacy Policy, the storage period regarding that purpose applies as 
well.    </p>

competitive play, and to compare scores and progress. We use the 
respective platform standard versions of these services and only 
reference the username/email associated with your saved data, scores, 
and game progress.</p>
<p><strong>d. Legal Basis</strong></p>
<p>The legal basis for processing data based on our legitimate interest is Art. 6 para. 1 let. f) UK GDPR. </p>
<p><strong>e. How Long</strong></p>

the player account is active. Once the player account has been deleted 
or the retention period of 5 years of inactivity has been reached the 
data will be deleted along with the player account data.</p>

<h2 id="viiigroupcooperation">VIII. Group Cooperation</h2>
<p>We are part of a group of gaming studios that are owned by our parent
 company Modern Times Group MTG AB ("MTG"), a Swedish gaming company. We
 cooperate with MTG and the other gaming studios of the group (each a 
"Group Company") to learn from one another, help each other and improve 
how we all make games. We like to see ourselves as a small gaming 
village in which we strive together to make great games.</p>
<h3 id="jointcontrollerships">Joint controllerships</h3>
<p>In some cases when we cooperate with MTG and/or a Group Company, we 
jointly determine if and how certain personal data of yours is 
processed. In such a case the involved companies each are controllers of
 your data when doing so. We have concluded an agreement with MTG and 
all Group Companies in which the rules for our joint controllership are 
set out and which also includes so called standard contractual clauses 
which ensure that personal data of European players is adequately 
safeguarded when transferred between us and a Group Company which is not
 established in the European Union or a country considered to have the 
same level of data protection as the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Joint controllerships between us and MTG or us and a Group Company:</strong></p>
<h3 id="1mergersandacquisitions">1. Mergers and Acquisitions</h3>

 selling a company. In such cases a strictly limited number of personnel
 involved in such a transaction can receive access to personal data 
(e.g., names, email addresses, unique identifiers) included in relevant 
documentation shared by a potential seller or determine which personal 
data is shared with a potential buyer and how this shall be done. 
Principally, personal data is anonymised before it is disclosed and, 
should it be necessary to disclose personal data, such disclosure of 
personal data will be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>b. Who</strong></p>
<p>Recipients of the processed personal data can be our providers of 
office tools, providers of data rooms as well as external financial and 
legal advisors, MTG, involved Group Companies, and the potential buyer. 
We can receive your personal data from a Group Company, or a potential 
seller in which case the same recipients can apply.</p>
<p><strong>c. Why</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of such a cooperation is to review relevant material 
shared with us by a potential seller, so we and/or MTG, and/or the

 so that we can sufficiently defend ourselves against claims, and by 
relevant legal obligations to retain documents. If a transaction has 
been successful, we might be obliged to store the respective personal 
data according to the applicable statutory provisions, in which case we 
will store the documents according to the retention periods stated in 
such provisions. Personal data that is no longer relevant if a 
transaction has not been successfully made, will be deleted if it is not
 relevant for another purpose under this privacy policy.</p>
